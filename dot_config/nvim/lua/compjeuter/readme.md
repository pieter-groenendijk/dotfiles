## TODO
- [x] LSP's 
- [x] autocomplete 
- [x] Fix: Always two LSP's running
- [ ] Fix: The `require('lspconfig')` "framework" is deprecated, use vim.lsp.config (see :help lspconfig-nvim-0.11) instead.
Feature will be removed in nvim-lspconfig v3.0.0
- [ ] On first start fuzzy file finder doesn't update on typing. Can't search. 
- [ ] When opening neo-tree, open focused on current file
- [x] Something to move betwen windows, such as neo-tree and code window.
- [x] disable automatic wrapping, maybe make toggable?
- [ ] IGNORE: workspaces/code tabs
- [x] neo-tree bindings
- [ ] When all windows close, don't automatically close nvim too. I tend to 
close it without intended.
- [ ] Ctrl+/ -> comment selected lines
- [ ] when pasting, also automatically format `=` that selection.
- [x] markdown table formatting
- [ ] Small banner-like component that shows amount of errors, warnings found by lsp in a file.
- [ ] Yanking, does also copy to clipboard; clipboard and buffer are synced?
- [ ] Markdown viewer, remove jumping, maybe one use it for tables? 
- [ ] Absolute tabs, with keymappings
