# Controls how many threads will be used for compiling (jobs) -> parallel make jobs
# 	--jobs -> The number of parallel processes (jobs) `make` should use during compilation
# 	--load-average -> Maximum load average on system waiting for cpu time, that will determine if it will pause additional jobs.
MAKEOPTS="--jobs 4 --load-average 5"
# Similar to MAKEOPTS, however it specifies now the amount of compilation jobs but the amount of `emerges` that will all have the specified job amount by MAKEOPTS.  
# Only load-average set. This way the system will keep the system's load average around 4. It can then start N compilation job according to MAKEOPTS.
